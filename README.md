# HTML5-Solitaire

This project was created in fall 2014 at LUT on www course as a first assignment. The main point of the assignment was to show a knowledge of DOM manipulation. Because of that, the game itself isnÂ´t made in the best possible way. More ideal way of creating game like this is (imo) a canvas. This is more of a demo of technology.
